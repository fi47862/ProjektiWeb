A couple of weeks back, we were able to show you AMD’s Radeon RX 6800 and Radeon RX 6800 XT in action, across an array of games and applications, 
in two different systems, with and without Smart Access Memory enabled. In that piece, we came to the conclusion that AMD’s latest high-end gaming 
GPUs are worthy adversaries for their NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series counterparts – the GeForce RTX 3070 and 3080. Today, however, we get to move all the way up the 
stack and show you Big Navi’s, Big Daddy, the Radeon RX 6900 XT, which AMD claims can go head-to-head with NVIDIA’s powerful GeForce RTX 3090. 
If you recall, the Radeon RX 6900 has more compute units than the Radeon RX 6800 XT, more texturing performance, and a special binned GPU AMD called “the best of best” 
to ensure maximum efficiency and higher sustained clocks. You wouldn’t know it upon first inspection though, because the Radeon RX 6900 XT looks exactly like the Radeon RX 6800 XT, 
but underneath its familiar exterior, the 6900 XT features a fully-enabled Navi 21 GPU
